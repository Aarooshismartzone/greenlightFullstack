            <p>
                Serverless architecture is gaining traction in 2025 for its scalability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of deployment. By relying on cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, developers can focus on writing code without worrying about server management. This trend is especially popular for microservices and event-driven applications.

        <p class="text-xl">Childhood is one of the most fragile stages of human life. It is the stage that forms the base of the development of the person. So, growth in all forms indeed is a serious thing to look for in a child.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">We often see malnourished children around us. It is not that all of them hail from extremely poor families and are thus, not fed properly. At times, we see children from well-to-do families as well in the same condition.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">There may be reasons for this. The food we give to the child may not contain that particular nutrient that the child&apos;s health is starving for. But how would we know what that particular nutrient is, or what food contains the same? We hear different suggestions from different people and ultimately end up in confusions. We try different methods. But what we lastly see is that there is no required growth in the child. The child may show growth on one aspect but lag behind in the other. Or maybe if they are physically fit, they may show psychological disorders.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">Some of us, at this stage, ignore this and stop taking any measure considering that things will get okay as the child develops age. But sadly, it often results in the opposite. Those children ultimately grow up to be extremely short-height, underweight, overweight, or mentally unstable. There may be many other problems. As a result, they are often prone to mockery, several diseases and it also becomes life-threatening at times. And the bitter truth is that hardly can any step be taken at that stage.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">So in order to prevent such things one must realize the importance of helping a child catch up on lost growth before it is too late. It indeed is the call of the moment and must be tackled with as early as possible. It is true that an individual may have least knowledge on which vitamin or mineral is required for the growth in one aspect. But experts are always there to help us around. There are health-drinks available in the market that contain all the required nutrients for a child in necessary amounts, and have been clinically proven to provide all round growth to a child. They may be provided to the child as a part of their staple diet. They are often seen to have helped a child recover the growth issues.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">Well, even in this case, one must be careful while buying the product. One must see the health drink one is buying is genuine or not, as several similar-looking products also have flooded the market. One must remember that the milk powder fed to infants and the one used as milk-substitute while preparing tea are completely two different things though they look and taste almost the same.</p>
        <p class="mt-4 text-lg">Well, if problems still persist, in my opinion, one must consult a reputed physician. But in no case must one ignore it. Timely taken measures will lead to recovery of all the problems the child faces, and the child ultimately will grow up to be a healthy man or woman, giving a helping hand in making the world a much better place to live in.</p>
